# Unified-Power-Flow-Controller

<p>
Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is the most advanced FACTS solution which provides independent active power and reactive power control of the transmission system. The UPFC is a combination of static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and a static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) coupled via a common DC voltage link.

Due to the dynamic and flexible control in both active and reactive power UPFC can bring a bunch of benefits to power transmission system:
1.Flexible power flow control</br>
2.Dynamic voltage regulation</br>
3.Improved system stability</br>
4.Power oscillation damping</br>
5.Regulation of loop current in meshed network to achieve optimal load flow</br>
6.Increase of transmission capacity of existing network and avoid installation of new lines</p>

UPFC solution from NR is based on state-of-art MMC converter. Through connection of sub-modules in series power regulation at various high voltage levels is achieved according to system requirement.
